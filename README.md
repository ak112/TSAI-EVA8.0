<h1 align="center">EVA 8.0 (Extensive Vision AI)</h1>

This contains the solutions to the assignments given in The School of AI - Extensive Vision AI 8.0

1. [Python Basics](Coming soon)
   
2. [Neural Architecture](Coming soon)

3. [First Neural Network](Coming soon)

4. [PyTorch 101](Coming soon)

5. [Architecture Basics](https://github.com/ak112/TSAI-EVA8.0/blob/master/03_Architecture_Basics/README.md)
   
   Here we were required to train MNIST to achieve 99.4% accuracy with given constraints.
   
6. [Coding Drill](https://github.com/ak112/TSAI-EVA8.0/blob/master/04_CodingDrillDown/README.md)

   This was very important to realise the basic steps required to make a neural network and then go on to optimize it, to get the perfect model size and accuracy, very      important, please see its documentation, and all the notebooks
   
7. [Normalization Regularization](https://github.com/ak112/TSAI-EVA8.0/blob/master/05_NormalizationRegularization/README.md)
    
    This assigment focuses on the importance of normalization and regularization in neural networks.

8. [Advanced Convolution](https://github.com/ak112/TSAI-EVA8.0/blob/master/06_AdvancedConvolution/README.md)

   Here I implemented various convolution types in a network architecture including standard convolution layers, depthwise separable convolution layers and dilated          convolution layers with standard operations of Batch Normalization, Dropout and ReLU activations functions. The max pooling was replaced by 3 3x3 layers with stride      of 2 instead. Thr network utilized 159,552 params and achieved an accuracy of 84.94% in 150 epochs.
   
9. [Advanced Training](https://github.com/ak112/TSAI-EVA8.0/blob/master/07_AdvancedTraining/README.md)
   
   Here i was introduced to ResNet18 and CIFAR dataset with aim to get 85% test accuracy.
